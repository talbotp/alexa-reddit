# Alexa Reddit Crawler #

Here we will be developing an Amazon Alexa Skill that can be used to do the following:

* Crawl top new posts in your favourite subreddits and read them to you.
* Have an android app which you can use to search subreddits to add to them, alternatively you should be able to do this with your voice.
* There should be connectivity with Flash Briefing, but also a keyword if you JUST want reddit news and not everything else.

## How will we do this? ##

First we must research Alexa development, and figure out basic architecture of this.
